            <h1>Patriarchy</h1>
            <h3 class="blog-subtitle">My two cents on the invisible killer in society.</h3><br/>
            <p><i>Hey there. Welcome to my first article.</i></p>

            <p><i>This is my first take at writing a blog, so, bear with me.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>Why this topic, you may wonder. Things like these intrigue me, that even in the modern-era exist like they </i></p><br/>
                
            <p>What is ‘patriarchy’? According to Wikipedia, ‘patriarchy’ is a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property.</p>
                
            <p>In simple words, ‘patriarchy’ can be defined as the practice of males being dominant over females in all substantial aspects of society, which renders females to be menial child-bearing factories.</p>
                
            <p><i>Seems enough to be a social evil?</i></p>
                
            <p>While patriarchy was a concept prevalent in ancient times when the position of women in society was believed to be inferior to that of men, it seems, though the world has taken huge steps in the path to modernism, patriarchy still raises its ugly head all around the world. It is not necessary to look at large-scale world events to observe the presence of patriarchy, the smallest of happenings indicate the ill-practice to be at the root.</p>
                
            <p>Be it the pettiest of quarrels in households, or the biggest of battles for wealth. Men are bathed in milk, while women seem to have brought ill-fate due to them being 'inferior' intellectually.</p>
                
            <p>Men make important decisions, while women are supposed to oblige quietly. Even if the question is of a woman's personal choices. Why? Because men have descended from the gods, while women are the successors of slaves?</p>
                
            <p><strong>The need for feminism highlights the existence of this illogical, inhumane practice, which is the cause of the suffering of women all over the world.</strong></p><br/>
                
            <p><i>Still reading? My intention of writing this has been fulfilled.</i></p>
                
            <p><i>Do tell me what you think about this article by reaching out on social media.</i></p><br/>
                
            <p><i>That would be it for this piece.</i></p>
                
            <p><i>Cheers.</i></p>
